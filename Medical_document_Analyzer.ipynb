            "Differential diagnosis includes:\n",
            "\n",
            "## - Most Likely: Sjögrens Syndrome\n",
            "\n",
            "Assessment: The patient has a personal history of autoimmune disease and a positive HLA genotype. He was diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis 2 months ago. His presenting symptom of bilateral joint pain in the knees and fingers paired with a positive RF, CCP, and decreased CD4 count made this diagnosis very likely. Sjögrens Syndrome is very heavily associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, estimated prevalence between 17-30\\% ${ }^{8}$ in those with previously diagnosed Rheumatoid Arthritis. The patient's laboratory and imaging studies, including a positive SS-A, neck CT showing chronic enlargement of the Parotid Gland, paired with the symptom of dry mouth and a burning sensation of the eye, a possible manifestation of dry eyes, are suggestive of Sjögrens Syndrome. Another possible cause of the burning sensation is trigeminal neuralgia, a neurological manifestation of Sjogren's syndrome. However, this patient also presents with some of rarer manifestations of Sjögrens Syndrome. According to UpToDate: Clinical manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease, normochromic normocytic anemia can be seen in up to 20\\% of sjogrens patients. Further, \"Patients with SS may exhibit abnormal counts in any cell line, and patients with cytopenia often have involvement of more than one cell line\"3. This hematologic manifestation of disease accounts for many of the abnormal blood tests including the anemia and leukopenia. This anemia could be the underlying cause of the lightheadedness and muscle weakness. Further, a more rare manifestation of Sjögrens Syndrome, is autonomic neuropathy3. Autonomic neuropathy manifests as headache, lightheadedness, early satiety, vomiting, weight loss, and sweating abnormalities. The patient's headaches with lightheadedness, as well as his GI symptoms and night sweats can be explained by the neurological manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome. Finally, autoimmune diseases are often associated with cutaneous manifestations. Some of these, such as the malar rash of lupus are well defined, while others are ill defined. The preauricular rash can be seen as an atypical cutaneous presentation of Sjogren's syndrome.\n",
            "\n",
            "Plan: A Schirmer test would help differentiate if the burning sensation in the eyes is due to dry eyes or another cause, possibly trigeminal neuralgia. Acutely, the patient should be started on corticosteroids to treat the acute symptoms of Sjögrens syndrome. Long term, hydrochloroquine or an immunosuppressant may want to be considered. This should help with the joint pain and constitutional symptoms. Monitoring of RBC and WBC should be continued to make sure they return to normal ranges after this acute event.\n",
            "\n",
            "## - Alternative: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)\n",
            "\n",
            "Assessment: SLE is another very possible diagnosis. The history of autoimmune diseases, paired with the SS-A and dsDNA can point us towards a diagnosis of Lupus. The anemia and leukopenia can also be accounted for by SLE. However, SLE would not explain the dry mouth and burning eyes, nor would it explain the parotid gland involvement. However, the macular rash in the pre-auricular area, which the sister described as extending over the eyelids and bridge of the nose, does sound suspicious of the malar rash. However, at the time of physical exam, the rash was only seen in the pre-auricular area. The patient denies any photosensitivity. While SLE cannot be ruled out at this time, Sjogren's Syndrome accounts for a more global diagnosis of the patient's symptoms.\n",
            "\n",
            "Plan: Continue to monitor kidney function, as SS-a in Lupus increases the risk of Lupus Nephritis. Treatment for acute exacerbation is still corticosteroids.\n",
            "\n",
            "# - Do Not Miss: B-Cell Lymphoma \n",
            "\n",
            "Assessment: Patients with both Rheumatoid Arthritis and Sjögrens syndrome have an increased risk of B-Cell lymphoma. This patient is experiencing night sweats, unintentional weight loss, subjective fever, and lymphadenopathy. He also has enlargement of the Parotid gland. The severity of this diagnosis makes it a do not miss in the differential. However, the small size of the lymph nodes, $4-5 \\mathrm{~mm}$, and the nature, not-fixed, makes this diagnosis less likely. Further, while the patient is experiencing Leukopenia, it is not extreme. We would expect a much lower WBC if this were a lymphoma.\n",

            "\n",
            "- **Diagnosis Matching Symptoms**: The primary diagnosis is not explicitly mentioned, which is a significant concern. The patient's symptoms (lightheadedness, weakness, joint pain, headaches, nausea, and vomiting) and medical history (Rheumatoid Arthritis diagnosed in January 2018 and a strong family history of autoimmune diseases) suggest a possible autoimmune component. However, the absence of a clear primary diagnosis makes it challenging to assess alignment fully.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Treatment Appropriateness**: The treatment plan is insufficient. The patient is only continuing with Ibuprofen PRN for headaches and joint pain, which may help manage symptoms but does not address the underlying autoimmune condition. Rheumatoid Arthritis typically requires more targeted therapy, such as Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), to prevent disease progression.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Medication Selections**: The use of Ibuprofen PRN is appropriate for short-term management of pain and inflammation but is inadequate for long-term management of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The lack of prescription for DMARDs or other immunomodulatory medications is a significant oversight.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Recommendations\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Alternative Treatments to Consider**:\n",
            "  - Initiate a DMARD, such as Methotrexate or Hydroxychloroquine, to address the autoimmune component of Rheumatoid Arthritis.\n",
            "  - Consider a short course of corticosteroids (e.g., Prednisone) to reduce acute inflammation and symptoms.\n",
            "  - Physical therapy and lifestyle modifications to manage joint pain and improve functional status.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Suggested Medication Adjustments**:\n",
            "  - Discontinue or minimize the use of Ibuprofen due to the risk of gastrointestinal and renal side effects with long-term use.\n",
            "  - Add a DMARD as first-line therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis.\n",
            "  - Consider low-dose corticosteroids for short-term symptom control if symptoms are severe.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Additional Tests if Needed**:\n",
            "  - Complete blood count (CBC) to assess for anemia, which can occur in chronic inflammatory conditions.\n",
            "  - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to monitor disease activity.\n",
            "  - Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibody (Anti-CCP) to confirm the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.\n",
            "  - Liver function tests (LFTs) and renal function tests before starting DMARDs.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Risk Assessment\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Potential Complications**:\n",
            "  - If Rheumatoid Arthritis is left inadequately treated, there is a risk of joint damage, disability, and systemic complications such as cardiovascular disease.\n",
            "  - Long-term use of NSAIDs like Ibuprofen can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, renal impairment, and cardiovascular risks.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Drug Interaction Concerns**:\n",
            "  - No significant drug interactions are noted in the current regimen, but the introduction of DMARDs may require monitoring for potential interactions and side effects.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Follow-up Recommendations**:\n",
            "  - Schedule a follow-up appointment within 4-6 weeks to reassess symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.\n",
            "  - Regular monitoring of disease activity and side effects of medications.\n",
            "  - Patient education on the importance of adherence to prescribed therapy and lifestyle modifications.\n"
